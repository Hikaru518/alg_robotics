GUIDE TO PROJECT 2
PEIGUANG WANG, SICHAO ZHANG

WHAT HAVE WE DONE?
-Implement all 3 functions.
-Write a function named transformation.h to solve the rotation problem in Problem 3.
 This Transformation function is used to calculate the coordinates of the point after rotating around the pivot point in counterclockwise by theta.
-We use MATLAB to visualize the mistake robots and given obstacles in workspace and try to understand why these robots are not fit with the codes.

HOW TO RUN THE CODES?
